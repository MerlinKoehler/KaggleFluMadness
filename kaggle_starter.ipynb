    "You are given the early data for an outbreak of a dangerous virus originating from a group of primates being kept in a Maastricht biomedical research lab in the basement of Henri-Paul Spaaklaan building, this virus is dubbed the \"Maastricht Flu\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You have the medical records of $n$ number of patients in `flu_train.csv`. There are two general types of patients in the data, flu patients and healthy (this is recorded in the column labeled `flu`, a 0 indicates the absences of the virus and a 1 indicates presence). Notice that the dataset is unbalanced and you can expect a similar imbalance in the testing set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task:** build a model to predict if a given patient has the flu. Your goal is to catch as many flu patients as possible without misdiagnosing too many healthy patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The deliverable:** submit your final solution via Kaggle competition using the `flu_test.csv` data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maastricht Gemeente will use your model to diagnose sets of future patients (held by us). You can expect that there will be an increase in the number of flu patients in any groups of patients in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some benchmarks for comparison and for expectation management. Notice that because the dataset is unbalanced, we expect that there is going to be a large difference in the accuracy for each class, thus `accuracy` is a metric that might be misleading in this case (see also below). That's why the baselines below are based on the expected accuracy **per class** and also they give you an estimate for the AUROC on all patients in the testing data. This is the score you see in the Kaggle submission as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Baseline Model:** \n",
    "- ~50% expected accuracy on healthy patients in training data\n",
    "- ~50% expected accuracy on flu patients in training data\n",

    "- ~50% expected accuracy on flu patients in testing data (future data, no info on the labels)\n",
    "- ~50% expected AUROC on all patients in testing data (future data, no info on the labels)\n",

    "**Reasonable Model:** \n",
    "- ~70% expected accuracy on healthy patients in training data\n",
    "- ~55% expected accuracy on flu patients, in training data\n",
    "- ~70% expected accuracy on healthy patients in testing data (future data, no info on the labels, to be checked upon your submission)\n",

    "- ~65% expected AUROC on all patients, in testing data (future data, no info on the labels, to be checked from Kaggle)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading:**\n",
    "Your grade will be based on:\n",
    "1. your model's ability to out-perform the benchmarks (they are kind of low, so we won't care much about this)\n",
    "2. your ability to carefully and thoroughly follow the data analysis pipeline\n",
    "3. the extend to which all choices are reasonable and defensible by methods you have learned in this class"

    "There are a large number of missing values in the data. Nearly all predictors have some degree of missingness. Not all missingness are alike: NaN in the `'pregnancy'` column is meaningful and informative, as patients with NaN's in the pregnancy column are males, where as NaN's in other predictors may appear randomly. \n",

    "**What do you do?:** We make no attempt to interpret the predictors and we make no attempt to model the missing values in the data in any meaningful way. We replace all missing values with 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it would be more complete to look at the data and allow the data to inform your decision on how to address missingness. For columns where NaN values are informative, you might want to treat NaN as a distinct value; You might want to drop predictors with too many missing values and impute the ones with few missing values using a model. There are many acceptable strategies here, as long as the appropriateness of the method in the context of the task and the data is discussed."
